# bubblegame
This project involves creating a bubble-clicking game where players need to click on bubbles with numbers that match the target number shown at the top. The game includes a countdown timer, score tracking, and dynamic bubble generation. When the timer reaches 0, the game displays a "GAME OVER" message along with the player's final score.
